## Description

## Student Registration Form in PHP
This project implements a simple student registration system with PHP and MySQL. Users fill out a form to input student details like name, age, contact, and course. These details are stored in a MySQL database.

## Key Features

## Database Connection:
- Managed by the Config class (config.php), which connects to the student database using MySQLi.

## Form Submission:
- The form collects user inputs and submits them via POST to the PHP script.
- On submission, the insertData method in the Config class adds the data to the students table.

## Code Highlights:
- The Config class handles database connectivity and query execution.
- HTML form ensures user-friendly input and uses CSS for styling.
- This project is a beginner-friendly example of PHP and MySQL integration for managing basic CRUD operations.
